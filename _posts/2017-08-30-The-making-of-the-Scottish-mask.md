Following my design of the Scottish fencing mask, I thought that it would be great to bring it to life!  As I have a degree in product design and I love getting stuck in I decided to do it myself. I started by doing some research on methods for spraying fencing masks:

<ul>

    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd4xcPezta0" target="_blank">How to customise a fencing mask, a video by Kálmán Kozma on YouTube</a></li>
</ul>

This gave me a good understanding of my steps:

<ol>
    <li>Decide on the design to be applied</li>
    <li>Tape up the parts of the mask not to be sprayed (the bib, the back strap and any other fabric)</li>
    <li>Spray the primer/first layer (in this case white - to plug anywhere where the paint has chipped and to provide the base for the cross in the Saltire)</li>
    <li>Leave the paint to dry, at least for 45 minutes</li>
    <li>Apply a second layer of the primer/first colour (so that the original paint is suitably covered and that the gaps have been filled)</li>
    <li>Create a template with tape for the rest of the design that is being applied (in this case - a tartain design on the top as well as the Saltire cross on the front).  It is at this stage that I came across a problem.  Even though I tested the colour of the blue that</li>
</ol>


Considerations - I didn't want to apply too many layers as I wasn't sure how many it might take to plug up the holes that are essential for sight and ventilation during fencing!

I thought that there might be some work needed to remove the original paint but there was nothing that indicated as such so I decided to ignore this step.  Already knowing what my design was and the template masking needed ()

Marked it out with duct and masking tape

Tried to re-spray my other mask in black but discovered that I had used the wrong type of paint and it chipped easily.

Wrong colour

Right colour
