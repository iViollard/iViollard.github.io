Following my design of the Scottish fencing mask, I thought that it would be great to bring it to life!  I love getting stuck in I decided to do it myself and have outlined the steps that I followed below.

<h3>1. Do some research on how others have sprayed their own fencing masks</h3>
<p>I did this through Google and speaking to a few contacts in industry. I expected the application to be along the lines of remoing the previous coats, applying a primer and then your template on top.  Here's what I found online:</p>

<h3>2. Decide on the design to be applied</h3>
<p>At this point I had already decided on the design that I was going to use, having already created a design and explored others <a href="ScottishFencingMaskDesign.html" target="_blank" >as part of my Scottish mask design project</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Tape up the parts of the mask not to be sprayed (the bib, the back strap and any other fabric)</h3>
<h3>4. Spray the primer/first layer (in this case white - to plug anywhere where the paint has chipped and to provide the base for the cross in the Saltire)</h3>
<h3>5. Leave the paint to dry, at least for 45 minutes</h3>
<h3>6. Apply a second layer of the primer/first colour (so that the original paint is suitably covered and that the gaps have been filled)</h3>
<h3>7. Create a template with tape for the rest of the design that is being applied (in this case - a tartain design on the top as well as the Saltire cross on the front).  It is at this stage that I came across a problem.  Even though I tested the colour of the blue that</h3>


Considerations - I didn't want to apply too many layers as I wasn't sure how many it might take to plug up the holes that are essential for sight and ventilation during fencing!

I thought that there might be some work needed to remove the original paint but there was nothing that indicated as such so I decided to ignore this step.  Already knowing what my design was and the template masking needed ()

Marked it out with duct and masking tape

Tried to re-spray my other mask in black but discovered that I had used the wrong type of paint and it chipped easily.

Wrong colour

Right colour
