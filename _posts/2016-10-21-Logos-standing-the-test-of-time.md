smalldesc: The mark of a great logo is it's identity so I find it fitting that new logos are referring to their past.

Who says that logos have to be a specific reference to what the business does?  Or that they have to be flat, like recent trends? Natwest has made a slightly retro move back to it's original logo from the 60's, with a modern twist.

I found this on <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_natwest_by_futurebrand.php" target="_blank">Under Consideration, a website that brings brand changes and corporate updates to the world</a>.  I like it.

While I'm on it, they have also <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_british_fencing_by_we_launch.php#.WCSKWOGLRmA" target="_blank">reported a newly created identity for British Fencing</a>which I think is pretty impressive as an overall package.  I'm not the biggest fan of the logo on it's own, but it works really well as part of a larger piece (which is what a logo is meant to be anyway).
