<p>Have you ever seen a design that you think you could do better? Not bothered exploring it because too much effort would be involved for no return? Spotted missed opportunities? Tal Leming didn't let it stop him from having an idea during a football (or 'soccer' I suppose as he's in the USA) match and taking one strand of it all the way.</p>
<p><strong>The result?</strong></p>
<p>US Soccer adopted his design, asked him for more and have taken it on as the flagship of their identity fleet! I read <a href="https://typesupply.com/portfolio/90-minutes" target="_blank">the article on Type Supply</a> and found it fascinating from start to finish - just a little something to share and read while starting the day.
