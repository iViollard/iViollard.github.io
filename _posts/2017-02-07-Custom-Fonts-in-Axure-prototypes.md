Sick of Axure prototypes rendering a nicely designed page using Times New Roman?  I have always struggled to make high fidelity Axure prototypes look correct on computers that haven't got certain fonts installed.  This is because Axure doesn't support hosting a custom font somewhere...but NO MORE!

I have come across <a href="http://usabilitymatters.com/tools/axure_font_embed/#" target="_blank">this awesome tool on Usability Matters</a> that base encodes a font file for you so that your Axure file can read it properly.  Many problems sorted.  Thank you <a href="http://usabilitymatters.com/" target="_blank">Usability Matters</a>!
