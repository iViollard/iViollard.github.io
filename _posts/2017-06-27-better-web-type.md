<p>
The <a target="_blank" href="https://betterwebtype.com/triangle">Better Web Type website</a> uses a game to help teach those getting started with typography the balance that a paragraph should have. 

The Equilateral Triangle of a Perfect Paragraph is a theory developed by <a href="http://matejlatin.co.uk/" target="_blank">Matej Latin</a> in the Better Web Type course about web typography for web designers and web developers. It's a great tool for getting to understand how line-height, font size and line width need to be in harmony for great type design that's easy on the eye. The equilateral triangle is a perfect representation of how the three features work in harmony. The theory is explained in details in an <a href="https://css-tricks.com/equilateral-triangle-perfect-paragraph/" target="_blank">article on CSS-Tricks</a>.

The game puts theory into practice to teach you about the three features. Although it's fun (and I always find these tools to be somewhat useful) I don't agree with the theory's interpretation of line width - for which my score was punished! I scored 46/100.
