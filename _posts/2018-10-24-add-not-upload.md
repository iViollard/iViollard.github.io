<p>In my current role it was discovered that site users were not completing their goals, and after some investigation realised that it was because they were backing away from the term 'upload'.  The users were scared and the completion rate once 'upload' was switched to 'add' improved considerably.

    We should think to use friendly semantics all over - especially with words we take for granted.  It's easy to consider headers and button/link labels but this just goes to show how important proper content design is.
