Harry Brignull has set up a <a href="https://darkpatterns.org/" target="_blank">Dark Patterns website</a> to make people, designers and others alike, of the negative UX practices that are used in the UX industry.  From adding things into your basket to auto-selecting options, it's a great talk that exposes what's going on and a fantastic first step to making sure that UX stays user and not business focussed.  You can find the talk in the YouTube video below.
