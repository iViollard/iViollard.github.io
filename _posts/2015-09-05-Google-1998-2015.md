Google unveiled its new logo this week, to the surprise of many.  The worlds response? Uninspired.
</p>
                
<p>
Their new logo is too raw and childish, it feels completely unfinished and, most importantly, has lost its history. The typeface of the old logo was a clear touch point for people around the world, and not just users. It was completely distinguishable and put across everything they have achieved in the last 17 years - a company that leads revolution with the creation of an product that works SO much better than anyone else, followed by Google maps and Android but to name a few highlights.

<p>
For example, Coca-Cola would never dream of ditching a brand that has become so iconic around the world.
</p>
<p>
One could argue that this redevelopment is a clear example of that, but I believe they have completely changed identity and the outward foundation of everything they have achieved.
