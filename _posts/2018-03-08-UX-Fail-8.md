It may seem trivial but the difference between check boxes and radio buttons is a big one!  A check box is used when more than one option can be selected; whereas a radio button is for only allowing a single option.  This iPhone app presented me with a choice - one that I wasn't able to complete because they were prividing me with the wrong answers!  Poor, poor UX.
