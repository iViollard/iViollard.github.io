When you're phone keeps sending you notifications to update your software you have to assume that it's for the better, for this one however I've found myself feeling frustrated on a regular basis.  Consider this: my phone is locked and I get a notification telling me that I've received a WhatsApp message - I want to unlock my phone to view the message.  It used to involve these steps:</p>
<br>
<ol>
    <li>See WhatsApp notification</li>
    <li>Swipe to open the message</li>
    <li>The lock screen comes up</li>
    <li>Enter the passcode OR put your finger on the home button to use touch ID</li>
    <li>Read the message</li>
</ol>

<p>And look like this:</p>

<p>Now the journey looks like this:</p>
<ol>
    <li>See WhatsApp notification</li>
    <li>Swipe to open the message</li>
    <li>The lock screen comes up asking you to scan a finger for touch ID</li>
    <li>If it doesn't work (the finger hasn't been set up; the finger isn't recognised; it's broken; etc.) then click on "Use passcode"</li>
    <li>Enter the passcode</li>
    <li>Read the message</li>
</ol>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>My phone used to open the passcode screen by default when it was locked and automatically recognise when a finger had been detected for fingerprint recognition.  There was nothing wrong with it and it worked great.  Since the update however the passcode screen is now hidden behind a button that has to be clicked.

<strong>
The solution
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Leave both entry points available at the same step! Otherwise an unecessary 'click' is being added which is frustrating for users.
