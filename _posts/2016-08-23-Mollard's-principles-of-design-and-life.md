In an ever increasing corporate world I think it becomes even more important to remember who we are and that we are not robots. Each one of us has needs, desires, goals, humour, fears...characters that make us who we are.  
</p>
<p>
And it's important that we do! Can you imagine living in a bland world where none of the above exist? I thought it would be useful to list some of the principles that help guide me through life and a world of UX:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>say more with less</li>
    <li>start as you intend to go on</li>
    <li>be transparent</li>
    <li>you miss 100% of the shots you don't take</li>
    <li>the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result</li>
    <li>take more risks and live according to your own rules</li>
    <li>learn by doing</li>
    <li>take things just one day at a time</li>
</ol>
<p>
I have also found some quotes that help to guide me, very inspirational. 
</p>
<p class="quote">“Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves: ‘Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?’ Actually, who are you not to be? ... Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you… And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.” </p>
<p>- American author Marianne Williamson</p>
<p class="quote">"Refuse the anxiety. When you borrow trouble against what might be, you neglect the moment you have now to enjoy. The man who worries about what will next be happening to him loses this moment in the dread of the next, and poisons the next with pre-judgement."</p>
<p class="quote">"Life is for fun and for living, enjoy every moment and don't worry or panic about the little things. We make our own rules and aren't defined by the boundaries others place. Things are flexible."</p>
<p class="quote">"Being nice to someone you dislike doesn't mean you're being fake. It simply means you're mature enough to tolerate that individual."</p>
