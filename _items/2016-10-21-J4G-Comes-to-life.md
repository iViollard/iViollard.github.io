<p>I've gone solo!  For a little while now I have been thinking about doing my own thing and working as an independent - I can proudly say that it's happened and I'm doing it.  I'm looking forward to doing lots of great work and working with lots of fantastic people.  The long term goal is to set up a UX agency that has a number of clients, but this is a great starting point which enables me to help lots of people and lots of organisations.
