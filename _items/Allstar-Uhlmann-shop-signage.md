<h4>Some background</h4>
<p>
Allstar-Uhlmann changed shop location and needed to create new signs for attract customers - however they only had images and PDFs of the logo (which were unsuitable for scaling up in size or fitting on to new sign boards). I was asked if to could re-create it with some tweaks for improvements as well as putting the logo into a sign design.
</p>

<h4>The brief</h4>

<p>
Tweak the current logo to make it cleaner, bolder and more engaging so that when customers are driving by and looking for the shop it stands out and catches their eye.

<h4>The process</h4>
<p>

The shop owner wanted to use this opportunity to modernise the logo without looking for a complete re-design - just a few tweaks. He wanted it to be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>neater</li>
<li>bolder</li>
<li>more modern</li>
</ul>
<p>
The end users are shop customers and passers-by (advertising). Working iteratively with the shop owner to create a design he is happy with.</p>

<p>2016 has been the year of flat design and saw many brands (eBay, Google, Microsoft and Netflix to name just a few) re-working their image along 2D lines. There has also been a shift towards wider logos, circles using the magic grid and stepped colour changes (instead of gradients) - all of which are great for inspiration. </p>

<p>However as I wasn't looking at a full blown re-design and that the flat design options ticked more of the boxes, I chose to consider the others but only fully explore the flat options.</p>
<h4>The outcome</h4>
<p>The result of the work saw the following improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>a wider logo</li>
<li>no gradients</li>
<li>a secondary version</li>
<li>signs and artwork that can be easily created and modified</li>
<li>the company now has an Adobe AI file that can be used for future updates</li>
</ul>
<p>The result of the work is a logo that is more engaging, beautiful and obvious from the road side. </p>
