<h4>Some background</h4>
<p>
Olympus Fencing Club was a new fencing club based in West London.  They needed a website that would attract beginners and competitive fencers alike, get them noticed and provide all the information that any new member could need.
</p>

<h4>The brief</h4>

<p>
Design and build a striking and unique website for a new club to bring it to life online.
</p>

<h4>The process</h4>
<p>
To come.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>I sourced the imagery</li>
<li>I put together the brand palette</li>
<li>I built the site</li>
<li>I hosted it on my server</li>
</ul>

More to come.
<h4>The outcome</h4>
<p>The final website can be viewed at <a href="https://www.olympusfencing.com/" target="_blank">olympusfencing.com</a> and the project, including source code, is available on <a href="https://github.com/iViollard/olympusfencing" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
