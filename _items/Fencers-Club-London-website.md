<h4>Some background</h4>
<p>
Fencers Club London was a new fencing club for the elite that was opening in London. They needed a website that would stand out from the rest, get them noticed and provide all the information that any fencer or parent could need.
</p>

<h4>The brief</h4>

<p>
Design and build a striking and unique website for a strong club (that includes two British champions and a Polish World Cup winner) to bring it to life online.
</p>

<h4>The process</h4>
<p>

I identified the prospective users of the new site:
</p>
<ul>
<li>current club fencers</li>
<li>fencing parents</li>
<li>prospective members</li>
<li>investors</li>
</ul>

<p>Built on Wordpress. Worked with key stakeholders and user to identify requirements, test designs and get feedback on the site as it was being built. Conducted competitor analysis of other fencing club websites to identify some key components that are successful:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://saxonfencing.co.uk/" target="_blank">Saxon</a></li>
<li><a href="http://salleboston.com/" target="_blank">Salle Boston</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sallepaul.co.uk/" target="_blank">Sussex House</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sallekiss.org.uk/" target="_blank">Salle Paul</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Conducted best in breed analysis of other sports clubs to see where they have success, the content they have and engaging areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/" target="_blank">Chelsea Football Club</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.manutd.com/Splash-Page.aspx" target="_blank">Manchester United Football Club</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.equestrian.ca/" target="_blank">Equestrian Canada</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.silverstone.co.uk/" target="_blank">Silverstone</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gxltc.co.uk/" target="_blank">Gerrards Cross Lawn Tennis Club</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/index.html" target="_blank">Rolland Garros</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mercedesamgf1.com/en/mercedes-amg-f1/" target="_blank">Mercedes Formula 1</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Worked iteratively in the code.</p>
<h4>The outcome</h4>
<p>The final website can be viewed at <a href="https://www.fencersclublondon.com/" target="_blank">fencersclublondon.com/</a></p>
