<h4>Some background</h4>
<p>
Ace of Hearts Fun Casino came into existence in February 2017 by those who saw an opportunity to improve the services currently offered in central London. The market has lots of competitors who cater for events in and around London but who are based in the outskirts or regions outside of London. Ace of Hearts brings together a fun and professional service based inside central London.
