<h4>Some background</h4>
<p>
My last portfolio website was designed and built when I was a student, in a very rushed manner so that I had something that I could show for interviews.  As a result, it hadn't been done in a very considered way and came with added costs.  I also wanted to use all the skills that I have, which meant engaging end users and writing the code myself - once I had designed it - using agile.
</p>

<h4>The brief</h4>

<p>
Design, build and continuously test a new, fully responsive, portfolio website for Christopher Mollard.  It should provide a completed overview of employment history, key skills, previous work and projects as well as clearly demonstrating design thinking (in the form of a blog).  It should also have no recurring costs, or as few as possible, and be simple to maintain.
</p>
<h4>The process</h4>
<p>

To come. The final product can be viewed at <a href="http://www.cmollard.co.uk/" target="_blank">cmollard.co.uk</a>.
