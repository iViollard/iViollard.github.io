<h4>Some background</h4>
<p>
Homes in Harmony is a small business that focuses on house upkeep and renovation using environmentally friendly materials. This unique selling point helps them stand out from the competition. Friendly staff that are able to solve any problem means that they really are who you want to be going to when it comes to home repairs.
