We know what happens here don't we? You want to pay for your shopping, so you get out your contactless card (or iPhone), tap and be on your merry way.

<p>
<strong>Think again.</strong>

<p>
The limit for paying on a contactless card is £30 and for some reason the scenario where your total is over £30 decided to be ignored - so we still see the icon when it no longer applies. Essentially the UXer lost the tug of war - very frustrating! Especially when you'd get a big reward for a small amount of effort. All for the sake of a simple solution where the machine has a small line of code that says:
</p>
<p>
"If the total is more than £30, don't show the contactless icon" .
