<h4>Some background</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://www.fencersclublondon.com/" target="_blank">Fencers Club London</a> is a high performance fencing club founded by two British team fencers and national champions with a mission to develop the next generation for Olympic success.  Since the club's foundation in 2015 it has produced champions at both national and international level.  To gather more interest in their coaching methods, share their knowledge and be more visible they decided to run a week long fencing camp and needed a design.
