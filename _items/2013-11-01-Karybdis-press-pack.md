<h4>Some background</h4>
<p>
Karybdis are a heavy metal band that have been progressively making more of an impact on the UK scene with very positive reviews and invites to big events.
</p>

<h4>The brief</h4>

<p>
Design a press pack, in A4 format, that captures the energy and excitement of the band so that promoters have a great idea of who the band are, their followers and what they bring to an event. It needs to be eye catching so that, at only a glance, an interested party's interest is peaked and they want to book them.
</p>
<h4>The process</h4>
<p>
To come.
