    The rankings for British Fencing are a monthly update, in spreadsheet format, prepared by a volunteer who has to spend a lot of time and effort manually preparing the spreadsheet.  For each competition that is eligible to be included the following steps occur:
    <ol>
        <li>Download the results from the BFA results page.</li>
        <li>Check that they are suitable for inclusion - e.g. BFA numbers, nothing "odd" which would exclude it.</li>
        <li>Copy the results into the working spreadsheet (using paste special -> text normally) and correct any obvious data errors.</li>
        <li>Copy the pasted results from the holding area to the working list.</li>
        <li>In the main sheet (the one you see), fill in the header details and copy the formula down to the bottom (this will calculate the NIF).</li>
        <li>Correct errors/omissions.</li>
        <li>Add any missing fencers to the bottom of the sheet.</li>
        <li>Check.</li>
        <li>Copy / paste the results and calculations (using paste special -> values and number formatting) to fix the data.</li>
        <li>Remove the expired events.</li>
        <li>Add the FIE events</li>
    </ol>
    I wanted to help by automating some of these steps, which I was able to do by focusing on steps 3 - 5 to reduce the amount of time it takes by % ...
