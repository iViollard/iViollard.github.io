Having started as an intern, the first few months were spent shadowing designers to understand established processed between teams. I rotated between Interaction Design, Visual Design and Customer Experience. In each team I worked on wireframes, visual designs and with developers to deliver projects successfully and on time across desktop, mobile and mobile web platforms.

By the end of the internship I had been offered a contract extension and was working as a Junior Visual Designer. Responsibilities included leading designs on several projects, several of which went live on <a href="www.betfair.com" target="_blank">Betfair.com</a>.
