I decided to branch out so that I could focus on doing great work for clients and being able to dedicate time properly without the split that comes with being a consultant. By becoming a UX Contractor I have been able to give myself time to be more focussed on the work I deliver and the means to do a great job. I focus on all aspects of the UX spectrum from conception, definition, research, and delivery. I find fascinating insights, create useful wireframes and beautiful designs as well as working with developers and testers for high quality build and implementation that is on time and in line with user's needs.
    
I strive to be involved in the wider world of UX by attending Meet Up events and staying involved with the Product Design course at Brunel University. I am a guest lecturer on User Experience and attend <a href="http://madeinbrunel.com/" target="_blank">Made In Brunel</a> every year.
