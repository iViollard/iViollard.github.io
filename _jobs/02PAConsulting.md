<p>
My role keeps me involved in every stage of a project’s lifecycle, usually as User Experience lead and integrating UX with Agile development. As a leading member of PA’s UX Capability I have been responsible for graduate recruitment, UX promotion and events and working with key business stakeholders to create exciting and innovative opportunities to showcase UX for what it should really mean to a business.

Following a User-Centred Design approach I plan and run workshops with clients, stakeholders and users to determine the functional requirements of a product or concept to best understand both the business and user needs. I provide conceptual designs to vision my understanding, the fidelity of which may depend on the project. Working in the Digital Business sector means that I usually provide design iterations (Axure wireframes or pixel perfect images) - fed by validations through usability testing - although I also enjoy working as a front end developer - often writing code to bridge the gap between the design and development teams and assist the development teams wherever I can.

Much of my experience has been working within Agile and using the Scrum methodology, specifically being a lead UX designer or front end developer on a project. I am also a Certified ScrumMaster and enjoy the role, finding it’s purpose and results in the team quite satisfying.

I joined in 2013 at the rank of Analyst (junior) and was promoted twice in two years to reach the rank of Consultant (mid-senior).
